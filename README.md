## Recommendations
To follow along with me I suggest you have the following ready:

- A Linux virtual machine (Recommended: Debian, Ubuntu Desktop, or Fedora workstation. Of course, you can also work with a Windows or macOS system.) 

  Minimum 1 CPU and 1 GB RAM (Recommended: 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM)

  Update the system: 

    Debian/Ubuntu: `apt update && apt upgrade -y`

    Fedora: `dnf update -y`

  > Note: I suggest using VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, KVM or Proxmox for your virtual machines. 

- Visual Studio Code installed.

- An Azure Subscription with a separate user (with **admin** permissions) for lab purposes

> Note: !!! Creating infrastructure on Azure or other cloud providers can incur a cost. Do not apply infrastructure if you do not want to be charged. 

> Build in the cloud with an Azure free account: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ (It needs a credit card for the registration!)

- Two or more monitors (or a second system) to display additional resources
